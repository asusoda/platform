# Dashboard

Officer dashboard for Platform: the pages officers use to see and control one org, and a Superadmin page for the superadmin. Vite, React, Tailwind and TanStack Query.

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # VITE_API_URL
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build          # tsc, then vite build to dist/
npm run screenshots    # images for the landing page, see docs/frontends.md
npm run perf           # long lists: time of each step and long tasks
```
