# Agent files

Instructions and skills for AI coding agents working in this repository. `AGENTS.md` (also
`CLAUDE.md`) at the repo root describes the codebase; this folder holds the procedures.

`.claude/skills` is a link to `.agents/skills`, so Claude Code loads the same skills. Other agents
read the `SKILL.md` files directly.
