# Platform site

The landing page and documentation for Platform, built with Next.js and Fumadocs.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
```

`scripts/sync-docs.mjs` copies the repo's `docs/*.md` into `content/docs/` as MDX before every dev run and build, so `docs/` stays the only source for those pages. Pages written only for the site (introduction, quickstart, concepts) live in `content/docs/` directly. The landing page is `app/(home)/page.tsx`.

Deploy on Vercel with the root directory set to `site`.
